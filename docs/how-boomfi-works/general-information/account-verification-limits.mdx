title: "Account Verification & Limits"
---

At BoomFi, we are required to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB) checks before you can utilize our Card Ramp or OTC Exchange services. This helps us to comply with our anti-money laundry (AML) obligations as a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider.

Verification differs for individuals and businesses, with two tiers: Level 1 provides access with restricted limits, and Level 2 offers higher limits.

Here's the summary:
