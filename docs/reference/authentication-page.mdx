title: Authentication
---

BoomFi's API employs an API Key security schema to authenticate all HTTP requests. These keys are unique alphanumeric tokens generated by BoomFi, serving as a digital "key" that grants authorized access to specific API endpoints. This ensures that only approved users or systems can request and retrieve data from the API.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that BoomFi never stores the API key after creation (it is shown only once during creation) and cannot assist in recovering a lost key. Be sure to securely store your API key immediately after generating it.
</Callout>

The API Key is a critical element in our business operations, providing a secure and efficient way to access and utilize data, services, or resources offered by our application programming interface (API). In BoomFi, we use the x-api-method to protect information. This means you must include the x-api-key on the headers of each request. The following provides an example of how this should be done:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://mapi.boomfi.xyz/customers \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```

<Callout type="warning">
It is important to avoid sharing your secret API keys in public places like Github or Bitbucket since it can allow malicious API calls.
</Callout>

To generate your API key, access the [BoomFi dashboard](https://test.boomfi.xyz/dashboard), navigate to the API section, and create a new key. Please note that the key will only be displayed once, so be sure to store it securely.
