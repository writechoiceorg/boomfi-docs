The **List Events for an Organization** endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of events associated with your organization. These events correspond to the same data received via webhooks, providing you with access to historical event records. This is useful for auditing purposes or in case of connection loss, ensuring you can always review actions such as subscription management, payment transactions, and plan creation.
