The **Create a Merchant Settlement Account** endpoint allows you to add a new settlement account to your organization. Provide necessary details such as account type, supported currencies, and blockchain network information. Uniqueness checks will be performed to ensure that the combination of `org_id`, `reference`, `chain_id`, and `currency` is unique. Use this endpoint to expand your settlement options and manage payouts effectively.
