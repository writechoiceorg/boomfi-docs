BoomFi allows you to withdraw your money directly into your bank account. To be able to use this feature, you need to complete your **KYB** (Know Your Business) check. Afterward, you will have enabled the option to withdraw from your wallets to your bank accounts directly.

## KYB

**KYB** is a simple process BoomFi uses to maintain safety for everyone on our platform. To get started, please get in touch with our support at [\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#345b5a565b5546505d5a5374565b5b59525d1a4c4d4e), or go to the Dashboard and start a chat with us.

4. **Continue**
5. You will be presented with two choices: to fund the withdrawal by connecting a wallet or to send the amount manually.

* **Manually send the amount**: you will be presented a **QR Code**, and you can proceed to make the transfer as you prefer. After executing the transaction, you can confirm by clicking the **I've made the transfer** button.

* **Wallet connection**: A pop-up window will open so you can connect directly to your wallet to execute the transfer.

The withdrawal will stay pending until BoomFi confirms receiving the transfer or the process fails.

After the transaction happens, successfully or not, it will also appear on your transactions tab of BoomFi's Dashboard.
