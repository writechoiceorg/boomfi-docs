On this page, you will find guides that are your go-to resource for merging the powerful capabilities of BoomFi and [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/) to enhance your business operations. This allows you to take advantage of all BoomFi offers within your Chargebee platform.

BoomFi will now be able to incorporate a link for cryptocurrency payments into invoices generated by Chargebee, offering users a more seamless payment experience. As a result, BoomFi will serve as a payment method, providing a pay link for each invoice created and enabling customers to settle the invoice using cryptocurrency.

<Callout type="info" title="Autocharge">
  BoomFi does not offer automatic payment collection since we do not handle the "auto charge" functionality. If you want to enable the ability to automatically charge a customer in cryptocurrency, you must create a paylink through [BoomFi's dashboard](https://app.boomfi.xyz/dashboard), and the customer must pay by providing a wallet signature through the **Connect Wallet** method.

<Callout type="info" title="Webhook">
  Use the Webhook URL set above to configure your webhook in Chargebee. To learn how to configure it, see the [Webhook](#setup-webhooks) section of this page. Using a webhook is highly recommended due to the significant throttling penalties associated with relying solely on API calls.
</Callout>

10. Click **Connect**.

With everything correct, ChargeBee will appear as a connected integration, and at the top right corner of the screen, you will receive a Success pop-up.

#### Errors and Diagnosis

When executing the steps above, you may encounter an error, and the error icon will present you with relevant messages as below:

* **Invalid Chargebee Site name**: Please check if the site name is correct and corresponds to the one in the URL of your Chargebee account.

* **Invalid API Key**: Please check if the API key matches the one you’ve generated on Chargebee and that it is not **Disabled**.

### Setup Webhooks

Chargebee automatically synchronizes every 10 minutes between the systems. For instant sync, you can implement webhooks.

1. Have the webhook URL configured in Step 9 of [Enable integration](#enable-integration) in hand.
2. Navigate to to **Settings** > **Configure Chargebee** > **Webhooks**.
3. **Add Webhook**.
4. Enter a Webhook Name (E.g., “BoomFi Integration”).
5. Provide a **Webhook URL**. It needs to be in the following format:

```
https://mapi.boomfi.xyz/v1/integrations/webhook/Chargebee/<siteID>
```

6. Turn off the **Protect webhook URL with basic authentication**, **Set this as primary**, **Exclude card information from webhook call** options.
7. Select **All events** for the **Events to Send** option.
8. Click **Create**.
