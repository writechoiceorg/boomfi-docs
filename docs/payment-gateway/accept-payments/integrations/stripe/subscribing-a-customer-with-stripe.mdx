To correctly subscribe a customer to a product in Stripe Billing, using BoomFi as the payment processor, you will need to follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Integrate Stripe and BoomFi

The initial step of the whole process is described on the [BoomFi and Stripe Billing](/docs/stripe-billing) integration page. Validate if your integration is connected by accessing Integrations inside Settings. It should present you with the following image for the Stripe integration:

## Step 2: Create a Product in Stripe (optional)

In your Stripe dashboard, you need to start by creating a product. If you already have a product created, you can skip to [Step 3](#step-3-create-a-subscription-for-a-customer). Follow these steps to configure your new product properly:

1. Navigate to **Product Catalog** in your Stripe dashboard.
2. Click **Add product**.
3. Configure the required fields, such as name and price.
4. Save it.

<Callout type="info" title="BoomFi paylink">
  BoomFi will automatically generate a new paylink, and this will also be automatically added as metadata to the price's details. This paylink will also be added to any invoice related to the product.

</Callout>

## Step 3: Create a subscription for a customer

With your new product and a BoomFi paylink available, you can now subscribe a customer to this product. To perform this, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Customers**, and select the customer you wish to add a subscription to.
2. Select the **Create subscription** option in the dropdown menu.

3. Configure the subscription and add the product to it.
4. Under **Subscription settings**, you are required to turn off auto charge and Invoice payment page options.

<Callout type="warning">
  BoomFi needs this options turned off. BoomFi will ignore any invoice with auto charge turned on, as we don't handle the "auto charge" functionality.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Invoice paylink">
  After these steps, BoomFi will add a paylink to any invoice related to this subscription. You can validate this. Navigate to **Invoices** in Stripe's dashboard and access the newly created invoice details. The **Metadata** will present the BoomFi paylink related to the product. This is exemplified below:

</Callout>

## Succesful payment

After a successful payment, the Stripe invoice will be marked as **Paid**, and all the information related to the crypto transaction will be attached to it.
