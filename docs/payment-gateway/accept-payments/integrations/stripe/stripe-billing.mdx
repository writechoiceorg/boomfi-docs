On this page, you will find guides that are your go-to resource for merging the powerful capabilities of BoomFi and [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/) to enhance your business operations. This lets you take advantage of all BoomFi offers within your Stripe platform.

BoomFi will now be able to incorporate a link for cryptocurrency payments into invoices generated by Stripe Billing, offering users a more seamless payment experience. As a result, BoomFi will serve as a payment method, providing a pay link for each invoice created and enabling customers to settle the invoice using cryptocurrency.

<Callout type="info" title="Auto charge">
  BoomFi does not offer automatic payment collection since we do not handle the "auto charge" functionality. If you want to enable the ability to automatically charge a customer in cryptocurrency, you must create a paylink through [BoomFi's dashboard](https://app.boomfi.xyz/dashboard), and the customer must pay by providing a wallet signature through the **Connect Wallet** method.

## How to integrate

To fully integrate BoomFi with Stripe Billing, you need first to enable the integration and then set up your webhooks.

### Enable integration

To enable the integration, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Register or log in to **Stripe**.
2. Navigate to **Developers** in the top-right of the screen, then select the **API Keys** section.

3. Log In to your [BoomFi Account](https://app.boomfi.xyz/dashboard/).
4. Go to **Settings > Integration**, find **Stripe**, and click **Connect**.
5. Add your API Key from Stripe and click **Integrate**.

<Callout type="info" title="Webhook">
  BoomFi Stripe integration automatically adds the webhook URL. To learn how to configure it, see the [Webhook](#setup-webhooks) section of this page. Using a webhook is highly recommended due to the significant throttling penalties associated with relying solely on API calls.

### Check or Setup Stripe Webhooks Manually

Integration should automatically setup webhook in Stripe through your API KEY. To check and configure BoomFi's webhook in your Stripe account, you need to do the steps described below:

1. In Stripe's dashboard, navigate to **Developers** in the top-right of the screen, then select the **Webhooks** section.
