This page provides comprehensive guides to seamlessly integrate BoomFi's powerful crypto payment capabilities with [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/). Enable your customers to pay with cryptocurrency for both one-time purchases and recurring payments, all within your [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/) platform.

With BoomFi, you can now offer cryptocurrency as a payment option at checkout, alongside traditional payment methods, and unlock the full potential of crypto transactions.

  Currently, BoomFi's crypto payment option on WHMCS doesn't support **multiple-item checkout**. The following error message will be presented both to you, and in your customer's invoice:

## How to integrate

To fully integrate BoomFi with WHMCS, you need first to follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Sign up to BoomFi

First, you need to have a BoomFi Merchant account. You can create an account [here](https://app.boomfi.xyz/signup). Create an account, and complete the KYB process.

### Step 2: Generate an API Key

With access to [BoomFi's Dashboard](https://app.boomfi.xyz/login?return_to=%2Fdashboard), you need to generate an API Key.

1. Go to the **Settings** section of the Dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **API** Tab.
3. Click the **+ Create API Key** button, and give it a descriptive name.
4. Copy and save your newly generated key, as it will be used later on this guide.

### Step 3: Create Payment Links

You need to create a one-time and recurring payment link to add it to the **WHMCS** integration. Refer to the [Payment Link Creation Guide](/docs/pay-links#create-a-pay-link) to learn how to create your payment links.

<Warning>
  Its crucial to select the **Allow repeat payments without confirmation** option when creating the one-time paylink to allow for multiple checkouts.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Install BoomFi's Plugin on WHMCS

With BoomFi's Dashboard side configured, you now have to access your WHMCS account and install our plugin.

1. Navigate to **Apps & Integrations**.

## Testing the Integration

To use test mode in WHMCS, you also need to use test environment paylinks from BoomFi. To have test payment links, you need to generate these pay links in our [Test environment dashboard](https://test.boomfi.xyz/login).

## Switching to Live Environment

To change to live mode, you need to go back to the BoomFi Crypto configuration screen, presented in [Step 4](#step-4-install-boomfis-plugin-on-whmcs), un-tick the Test Mode option, and change the paylinks for those generated on the [Production Environment Dashboard](http://app.boomfi.xyz/).

Your WHMCS store is now ready to accept real cryptocurrency payments.
