The Customers section serves as a central hub for managing customer information and transactions. It encompasses all individuals who have interacted with your business, regardless of whether their transactions were successful. Additionally, it incorporates customers you've manually registered, thereby enhancing your database.

## Effortless customer registration

When a new customer uses one of your pay links to make a payment, BoomFi automatically registers them. No need for manual steps, it's all seamless. If you desire, you can add more information about each customer.

## Smooth transaction tracking

Customer interactions and transactions are tracked using unique Wallet Addresses. When a customer pays from their unique address, the system records the details in their profile on your dashboard.

## Manual customer registration

You can manually register a new customer by clicking the **Add customer** button. Fill in their **Name** and a unique **Wallet Address** to establish their profile. You may desire to add more information about each customer as well, and the following fields are optional:
