## Sharing your Pay Link ðŸ”—

After generating your Pay Link with BoomFi, you can share it with your customers through multiple channels:

<Callout type="info" title="Here are a few common ways to share your Pay Link:">
  * **Email**: Copy and send the Pay Link directly to your customers via email.
  * **Website or Blog**: Embed the Pay Link in an appropriate section on your website or blog.
  * **Social Media**: Share the Pay Link on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.
</Callout>

### Pre-filling the Customer's Data in the Pay Link

When you share a Pay Link with customers, you can improve their experience by pre-filling their name or email, eliminating the need for them to re-enter information you already have. This can be achieved by adding this information as query parameters of the pay link. The example link below shows you how to pre-fill both name and email:

```
https://pay.boomfi.xyz/Pr1l6WoErz?name=Tamara&[emailÂ protected]
```

## Connecting a customer to the Pay Link

When sending a pay link to a customer, you have the option to make a connection of the pay link with your customer through this customer's `id`. You can incorporate their `id` at the end of the pay link's URL, adding the parameter `customer_ident`. Below, you can see an example:

#### Original pay link URL

```
https://pay.boomfi.xyz/Pr1l6WoErz
```

#### Pay link URL with customer's id

```
https://pay.boomfi.xyz/Pr1l6WoErz?customer_ident=<YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID>
```

This will update the unique customer ID in the web app, which you can access through webhook calls.

## Redirecting after a successful payment

You can customize any BoomFi pay link to automatically redirect your customers after they complete a payment. This is possible by incorporating a redirect URL as a query parameter in the original pay link URL. To perform this, follow the example below:

<Callout type="info">
  If no `redirect_to` is set at the pay link level, the one provided in the query parameter will be used.
</Callout>

```
https://pay.boomfi.xyz/2bm4YuFSaw011jTWbevVPA3137q?redirect_to=<REDIRECT_URL>
```

As the example above shows, a `redirect_to` query parameter can be added to allow BoomFi to know where to redirect the customer after the payment.

#### Skip Redirect Delay

By default, BoomFi applies a 10-second delay before redirecting the customer. To skip this delay and redirect instantly, add the `skip_redirect_delay=1` query parameter to the URL:

  ```plaintext plaintext
  https://pay.boomfi.xyz/2bm4YuFSaw011jTWbevVPA3137q?redirect_to=<REDIRECT_URL>&skip_redirect_delay=1
  ```

#### Retrieve Payment Information

When redirecting to the specified URL, BoomFi adds a `pid` query parameter to the URL. This parameter contains the payment ID, allowing you to retrieve the payment details via the API. For more information, see the [Get Payment by ID API](/reference/get-payment-by-id).

Example redirect URL with `pid` parameter:

  ```plaintext plaintext
  https://my.redirectUrl.com?pid=<PAYMENT_ID>
  ```

## Changing the amount and currency of a pay link

BoomFi gives you the flexibility to change the amount and/or currency of a paylink on the go.

<Callout type="success" title="Use cases for this feature:">
  * Allow your customer to pay in another currency.
  * Give customers the ability to top-up their balance/wallet.
  * Tipping or donations are to be added to the final amount.
</Callout>

To use this feature, you will make an API call to the [Generate Variant URL endpoint](/reference/create-variant-paylink-url) and add the following query parameters:

* `amount`: The new desired amount of the paylink.
* `currency`: The new currency the pay link will be paid with.

You can also add the following to edit your pay link URL further:

* `customer_ident`: A customer's unique identifier to be connected to the generated pay link.
* `redirect_to`: a URL to redirect the customer upon successful payment.

## Managing Your Pay Links

BoomFi's dashboard allows you to efficiently manage your Pay Links. Hereâ€™s what you can find:

* **Information**: View specific details about the Pay Linkâ€™s attributes and settings in the Main details, Link details, and Checkout Information sections.
* **Transactions**: Check the payment history associated with the Pay Link.
* **Edit details**: Click on the "**â€¢ â€¢ â€¢**" button to edit details or/and deactivate the payment link. BoomFi allows you to edit almost all fields, except changing the type of the paylink between one-time and recurring.
