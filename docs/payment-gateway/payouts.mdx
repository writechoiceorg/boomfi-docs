In the Payouts dashboard section, you can easily oversee all generated payouts. Here, you can create new payouts, manage existing ones, and filter your payouts by four options:

* **Draft**: Payment transactions that have been initiated but not yet finalized. This stage allows users to review and make any necessary adjustments before confirming and scheduling the payout.
* **Scheduled**: Payouts that have been approved and set for automatic processing at a specific date and time in the future. This status provides users with the ability to plan and organize payouts in advance.
* **Completed**: Transactions that have been successfully processed and funds have been transferred to the intended recipients. This status indicates the successful execution of the payout and serves as a confirmation of the financial transaction.
* **Cancelled**: Transactions that were initiated but later aborted or terminated before processing. This status allows users to track and acknowledge instances where a payout request was halted or revoked, providing transparency and record-keeping for canceled transactions.
