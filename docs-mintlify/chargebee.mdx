On this page, you will find guides that are your go-to resource for merging the powerful capabilities of BoomFi and [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/) to enhance your business operations. This allows you to take advantage of all BoomFi offers within your Chargebee platform.

BoomFi will now be able to incorporate a link for cryptocurrency payments into invoices generated by Chargebee, offering users a more seamless payment experience. As a result, BoomFi will serve as a payment method, providing a pay link for each invoice created and enabling customers to settle the invoice using cryptocurrency.

<Info>
  BoomFi does not offer automatic payment collection since we do not handle the "auto charge" functionality. If you want to enable the ability to automatically charge a customer in cryptocurrency, you must create a paylink through [BoomFi's dashboard](https://app.boomfi.xyz/dashboard), and the customer must pay by providing a wallet signature through the **Connect Wallet** method.

## How to integrate

To fully integrate BoomFi with Chargebee, you need first to enable the integration, then set up your webhooks, and finally, understand how to use the custom fields option.

### Enable integration

To enable the integration, you need to obtain your Chargebee API key:

1. Log in to your Chargebee account.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Configure Chargebee** in the left-hand menu.
3. Click **Add API Key** under the **API Keys** section.

<Warning>
  Make sure to keep your API key secure and avoid sharing it with unauthorized individuals.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Use the Webhook URL set above to configure your webhook in Chargebee. To learn how to configure it, see the [Webhook](#setup-webhooks) section of this page. Using a webhook is highly recommended due to the significant throttling penalties associated with relying solely on API calls.
</Info>

10. Click **Connect**.

With everything correct, ChargeBee will appear as a connected integration, and at the top right corner of the screen, you will receive a Success pop-up.

#### Errors and Diagnosis

When executing the steps above, you may encounter an error, and the error icon will present you with relevant messages as below:

* **Invalid Chargebee Site name**: Please check if the site name is correct and corresponds to the one in the URL of your Chargebee account.

* **Invalid API Key**: Please check if the API key matches the one you’ve generated on Chargebee and that it is not **Disabled**.

### Setup Webhooks

Chargebee automatically synchronizes every 10 minutes between the systems. For instant sync, you can implement webhooks.

1. Have the webhook URL configured in Step 9 of [Enable integration](#enable-integration) in hand.
2. Navigate to to **Settings** > **Configure Chargebee** > **Webhooks**.
3. **Add Webhook**.
4. Enter a Webhook Name (E.g., “BoomFi Integration”).
5. Provide a **Webhook URL**. It needs to be in the following format:

```
https://mapi.boomfi.xyz/v1/integrations/webhook/Chargebee/<siteID>
```

6. Turn off the **Protect webhook URL with basic authentication**, **Set this as primary**, **Exclude card information from webhook call** options.
7. Select **All events** for the **Events to Send** option.
8. Click **Create**.
