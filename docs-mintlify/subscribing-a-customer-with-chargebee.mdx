To correctly subscribe a customer to a new plan in Chargebee, using BoomFi as the payment processor, you will need to follow the steps below.

<Warning>
  Using a webhook is highly recommended due to the significant throttling penalties associated with relying solely on API calls.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Integrate Chargebee and BoomFi

The initial step of the whole process is described on the [BoomFi and Chargebee](/docs/chargebee) integration page. Validate if your integration is connected by accessing **Integrations** inside **Settings**. It should present you with the following image for the Chargebee integration:

## Step 2: Create a plan in Chargebee

In your Chargebee dashboard, you will need a plan to begin with. If you do not have a plan created yet, follow these steps to create a new one:

1. Access the **Plans** page under the **Product Catalog** section.
2. Select **Create a Plan**.
3. Add the required information.
4. **Create** the new plan.

After creating it, you will reach a page with the following information about your plan:

Now you need to **Set Price** for each frequency the plan applies to:

1. Click **Set Price** for the desired **Frequency**.
2. Define the price for the plan.

For example, the image presents an ACME Premium plan with a Monthly frequency price of $12.99.

  As a new plan is created in Chargebee, BoomFi automatically generates a new Pay Link for this plan.

## Step 3: Subscribing a customer

Still, in the Chargebee dashboard, you will connect customers to the plan they want to subscribe to by creating a new subscription.

1. Access **Subscriptions**.
2. Select **Create Subscription**.
3. Select a customer to subscribe or create a new customer.
4. Select the plan your customer wants to subscribe to.
5. Inside **Billing Info**, you need to turn off **Auto-collection**. This is required for BoomFi integration.

<Warning>
  This must be turned off to allow BoomFi to automatically tag the subscription with a paylink.
</Warning>

After a moment, under the subscription details page in Chargebee, you will find BoomFi's pay link for this subscription under **Invoice Note**:

The subscription is completed, and the customer will receive BoomFi pay links to execute their subscription payments.

For future recurring payments, Chargebee automatically generates invoices, initially marked as **unpaid**, which are then updated to **paid** status following successful payment collection by BoomFi.
