Account-Specific Paylinks is a feature designed for merchants who manage multiple accounts across different currencies, payment chains, or geographic regions. This feature allows merchants to link specific accounts to their paylinks, giving them greater control and flexibility over payment settlements. It is ideal for platforms handling large volumes of accounts, allowing customization of how each payment is directed to specific accounts.

## Who Is This Feature For?

This feature is designed for platforms and businesses that:

* **Manage Multiple Merchants**: Account-specific Paylinks allow you to direct payments to the correct merchant accounts if you oversee payments for numerous merchants.
* **Require Granular Control**: Businesses needing precise control over which accounts are used for specific transactions.
* **Operate Across Various Chains and Currencies**: If your platform handles payments in multiple chains and currencies, associating accounts ensures the correct handling of each transaction.

## How to Use Account-Specific Paylinks

To create an account-specific paylink, merchants have two primary options for associating accounts:

* [Attach Accounts Using `account_ids`](#account_ids)
* [Attach Accounts Using `account_ref`](#account_ref)

<Info>
  Refer to the [Configuring Accounts with BoomFi's API](/docs/configuring-settlement-accounts) guide to learn how to create and manage your accounts.

### `account_ids`

The `account_ids` parameter lets you specify an array of account IDs directly in the paylink request. This is useful if you have exact accounts in mind that should receive the payment. Using the [Create Paylink](/reference/create-payment-link) endpoint, add the account IDs array to the request, as exemplified below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl
  curl --request POST \
       --url https://mapi.boomfi.xyz/v1/paylinks \
       --header 'accept: application/json' \
       --header 'content-type: application/json' \
       --data '
  {
    "name": "My New Paylink",
    "amount": "100",
    "currency": "USD",
    "account_ids": [
      1,
      2,
      3
    ]
  }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### `account_ref`

The `account_ref` parameter allows you to associate a general account reference with the paylink. This option helps group multiple accounts under a shared reference, making it more straightforward to attach a category of accounts rather than specific IDs. Using the [Create Paylink](/reference/create-payment-link) endpoint, add the account reference to the request, as exemplified below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl
  curl --request POST \
       --url https://mapi.boomfi.xyz/v1/paylinks \
       --header 'accept: application/json' \
       --header 'content-type: application/json' \
       --data '
  {
    "name": "My New Paylink",
    "amount": "100",
    "currency": "USD",
    "account_ref": "my_acc_reference"
  }
  '
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Things to Keep in Mind

* **Self-Management Is Key**: Choosing this granular approach means you are responsible for managing all aspects of your accounts and Paylinks.
* **Flexibility vs. Complexity**: While this feature offers great flexibility, it also requires diligent management to ensure everything operates smoothly.
