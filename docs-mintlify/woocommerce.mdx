On this page, you will find guides that are your go-to resource for merging the powerful capabilities of BoomFi and [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) to enhance your business operations. This allows you to take advantage of all BoomFi offers within your WooCommerce platform.

BoomFi will now be able to incorporate a link for cryptocurrency payments into invoices generated by WooCommerce, offering users a more seamless payment experience. As a result, BoomFi will serve as a payment method, providing a pay link for each invoice created and enabling customers to settle the invoice using cryptocurrency.

<Info>
  BoomFi does not offer automatic payment collection since we do not handle the "auto charge" functionality. If you want to enable the ability to automatically charge a customer in cryptocurrency, you must create a paylink through [BoomFi's dashboard](https://app.boomfi.xyz/dashboard), and the customer must pay by providing a wallet signature through the **Connect Wallet** method.

## How to integrate

To fully integrate BoomFi with WooCommerce, you need to:

* [Install and configure your Wallet](#Wallet)
* [Sign up and set up a BoomFi merchant account](#boomfi-merchant-account)
* [Install and configure the BoomFi Crypto Payments Plugin for WooCommerce](#boomfi-crypto-payments-plugin-for-woocommerce)

### Wallet

The first step is to install and configure your preferred wallet, connect to a Network, and import the tokens you want, such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and WETH. Once you have completed these steps, your wallet will be ready to receive payments using the tokens above over your selected network.

### BoomFi Merchant Account

To integrate with WooCommerce, you'll need a BoomFi merchant account. If you don't have an account, refer to the following links to set your up:

* [BoomFi Test Environment](https://test.boomfi.xyz/login?ref=blog.boomfi.xyz)
* [BoomFi Live Environment](https://app.boomfi.xyz/login?ref=blog.boomfi.xyz)

With your account fully configured, follow the steps below:

1. **Configure Your Settlement Wallet**: Refer to the [Set Up Settlement Details](/docs/setup-settlement-details) guide to learn how to set this up. You need to add your MetaMask wallet address to the Polygon Network and select the currencies you want to accept.

2. **Create a Payment Link**: WooCommerce requires a pay link so that customers can complete their payments. Refer to the [Pay Links guide](/docs/pay-links#create-a-pay-link) to learn how to create payment links in BoomFi's Dashboard and do the following:

   1. Name the new pay link as **WooCommerce Payments**.
   2. Set a default amount to it (which can be overridden later).
   3. Enable one-time payments with the option for repeat payments.

<Warning>
  Remeber to copy the generated link, as youâ€™ll need it when configuring the WooCommerce plugin.
</Warning>

3. **Generate an API Key**: In the [**API** section](/docs/api), create a new API key for secure integration with WooCommerce and save it, as the plugin will require.

### BoomFi Crypto Payments Plugin for WooCommerce

With everything set up on BoomFi's Dashboard, you need to configure the WooCommerce plugin. Make sure that WooCommerce is installed and configured on your WordPress site.

Follow these steps now:

1. **Install the BoomFi Plugin**: [Download and install the BoomFi Crypto Payments Plugin for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/boomfi-crypto-payments/?ref=blog.boomfi.xyz). Remember to activate the plugin through your WordPress admin panel.

2. **Configure the Plugin**: Access your WordPress dashboard and do the following:

   1. Navigate to the **BoomFi Crypto Payments** settings.
   2. Enable the plugin.
   3. Set the environment to **Test** (or **Live** for production)
   4. Enter the API key and payment link obtained in the previous step.
   5. Save your changes.

The BoomFi Crypto Payments Plugin is fully configured.

## Testing the Integration

Before going live, testing the plugin in a simulated environment is essential. Here is how you can test the integration:

<Info>
  It's a good idea to create a test product to check if everything works as expected.
</Info>

1. **Place a Test Order**: Go to your WooCommerce store, add the test product to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Select BoomFi Crypto Payments as the payment option, and continue with the checkout process.
2. **Complete the Payment in Test Mode**: On the BoomFi checkout page, enter the required information and select **Wallet Transfer**. Choose the Polygon Network and USDT as the currency. Enable **Test Mode** to simulate the payment, then reveal and confirm payment details.
3. **Verify the Payment**: Once the payment is simulated, you will be redirected back to your WooCommerce store. Log in to BoomFi as a merchant and WooCommerce as an admin to confirm the transaction status in both dashboards.

## Switching to Live Environment

After confirming that the test transactions work as expected, you can switch to the live environment. Here is how to configure the plugin for the live environment:

1. **Switch to BoomFi Live Environment**: Complete KYB in the [BoomFi Live Environment](https://app.boomfi.xyz/?ref=blog.boomfi.xyz), then update your settlement wallet and create a new payment link.
2. **Change from Test to Live Credentials**: Update the WooCommerce plugin settings with the live API key and payment link, replacing the test ones.
3. **Save Changes and Go Live**: Update the plugin configuration, choose **Live** as the environment, and save your changes.

Your WooCommerce store is now ready to accept real cryptocurrency payments.
